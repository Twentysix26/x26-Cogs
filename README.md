# x26-Cogs
Cogs made by Twentysix for the Red community

## Cogs
### Index
Allows you to browse a [Red-Index](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-Index/) repo/cog index directly from your Red instance, helping you discover new repos and cogs. This is integrated with the core Downloader, so you can easily install a new repo or a new cog by clicking a reaction. Yay technology!
### Defender
Protects your community with automod features and empowers the staff and users you trust with advanced moderation tools.
You can read [my write-up about this cog here](https://x26.it/2020/09/06/project-showcase-defender.html).  
This cog offers:  
- A wide range of modules, automatic and manual, designed to counter many common patterns of bad actors and thwart large scale attacks
- A very customizable experience: every single module can be fine tuned to better fit your community
- A smart way to subdivide your userbase in ranks, so that your regulars will never be caught in the crossfire
- An extremely versatile module, [Warden](https://github.com/Twentysix26/x26-Cogs/wiki/Warden), that allows you to define complex custom rules to better moderate, monitor and manage your community
- A unique (and optional) way to let your community help *you* when you can't
- The peace of mind that only a smart automod can bring :-)
